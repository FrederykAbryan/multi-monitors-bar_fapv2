GNOME SHELL VERSION:
GNOME Shell 46.0

STATUS:
Extension has been fully updated to use GNOME 46 modern APIs.
All direct add_actor() calls have been replaced with add_child().
Compatibility shim added for inherited methods.

DOCUMENTATION FILES CREATED:
- CHANGELOG-GNOME46.md (Detailed change log)
- README-GNOME46-UPDATE.md (Complete update guide)
- VERIFICATION.txt (This file)

Next steps if errors persist:
The remaining errors are likely from methods inherited from GNOME Shell's
base classes via copyClass(). These would require deeper refactoring of
the inheritance pattern itself.
